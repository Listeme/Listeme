# Competition

## Google Calendar

### Similarities:



* Able to track events and schedules.
* Able to create events and schedules.
* Able to add reminders to events and schedules.
* Sort things into groups and color code recurring events.
* supports .ics format importing/exporting.
* have a wide variety of views for the calendar, including: daily, weekly, monthly and yearly views 
* Be able to jot down notes


### Differences:



* Able to pin notes created at certain events directly to either the event or to the date
* Have an in-built pomodoro clock, with space for task assignment 
* The inbuilt journal feature 


### Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?


* Google is not a student focused product, so they do not necessarily focus on the self-reflections and note taking features that students would find particularly beneficial. 
* They also spread their services across multiple platforms so that they can provide incentive to users to use the G suite to get the full range of services that the user needs; thereby, expanding their brand.  
* If Google were to now add features like journaling or pomodoro sessions or note taking into Google Calendar, they would have to be able to combine all the features into one app rather than having them be spread across multiple services. This would cause their services to be less individually specialized.
* Also, Google takes pride in the fact that they continuously adapt and change via add-ons, rather than having one app be the stop-shop for every functionality. 
* Also, if they attempted to add more functionality to Google Calendar, it would not be ideal for their clientele who have now become accustomed to the features offered by the calendar.  

## GoodNotes

### Similarities:



* Able to create a note instantly
* Able to save notes under a user
* Able to show when the note was created
* Can organize notes into folders

### Differences:


* Rather than saving it separately somewhere, the notes are saved to the calendar.
* Git style version control, which allows individuals to see the changes that have been made 
* Regardless of OS, all users can use the product, thereby allowing them to log in through a variety of devices. 

### Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?

* Good Notes is a standalone product created particularly for note taking, rather than having the notes be integrated into a calendar format, unlike our app.
* Good Notes is exclusive to Apple products, which makes it less accessible on Windows software. The exclusivity encourages people to use Apple Products, but refrains people not using Apple to use the product. Having the app be available on Apple platforms also encourages Apple users to remain loyal due to the specialized services offered. Therefore, they refuse to make the product available on Android devices.
* Having the app accessible through various platforms would also require Apple to collaborate with other competing companies, which might not be ideal for creating a widespread presence of their brand. 

## Pomofocus 

### Similarities:

* Able to use the timer.
* Sync the tasks with the pomodoro time cycles.

### Differences

* If the tasks are not finished, move them to the next day in the calendar.
* Remind the user about their tasks at their chosen time.
* Able to block distracting websites during study sessions (Social Media websites, video streaming sites etc.).

### Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?


* Pomofocus is a standalone web application focused on pomodoro sessions, which means that it doesn’t have the integrated calendar feature. 
* Onus is on the user to be accountable for focusing on their task. For this app to block distracting websites, the company would need to develop an extension that would allow for a blocking feature.
