#### Team Organization

We created separate google docs for each task. We discussed during our team meetings on discord, what each document should contain, including what user stories we agreed on, how we wanted the interface to look, and etc. We had a couple members in the team act as scribes to then record the ideas. 

#### Decision Making

Since we wanted to make sure we all agreed with the specifications of the project; we decided to host multiple team calls to come to a consensus on our vision of the project. 

We aimed to get the majority decision in all our tasks. 

#### Prioritizing User Stories

We had first come with a user interface. We decided what our product would look like. Everyone pitched in with ideas and we storyboarded our concepts on MS paint. Once we had a vision for the project depending on everyone's ideas, we decided to come up with the user stories that would be necessary to implement our vision. 

We took ideas from our interface brainstorm and came up with supporting user stories. We all just pitched in ideas, and based on team agreement and conversation, we chose our user stories.  

In terms of rating the difficulty of the user stories, we decided as a group to rate the user stories from a range of 1 to 5. 1 being the least difficult and 5 being the hardest. 

#### Meetings

We met every two days to work on finishing sprint 0. We also had smaller meetings where people were working on different parts of the sprint 0 deliverables so that when the big meetings were held everyone was able to review what was made and come to an agreement on what was written. This helped us make sure we all were on the same page when it came to the product requirements and design.

#### Next Phase

We would like our tasks to be more specific; we would like to delegate tasks to smaller teams or individual members since it can be difficult to find a time on which everyone is available. 

We would like to continue holding smaller meetings. Since smaller meetings  allow for the meetings to be more specific, and it allows for time to be used more productively. 

We would also like to continue having frequent group meetings with everyone, to help keep on the same page since we want everyone in the group to know exactly what the product is envisioned for, and add their feedback and suggestions. We intend to make better notes during meetings to be able to bridge this gap between some of the team members, and help if one or multiple people can not attend.
