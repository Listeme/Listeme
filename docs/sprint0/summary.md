# Key Scenarios

## Scenario 1:
Currently, Joe uses a combination of Google Calendar, Goodnotes, Pomofocus, and StayFocused to maximize his productivity and be able to organize around his deadlines. He wishes there was a way to combine all the features of the apps he uses into one location so he is not constantly having to check different devices and be bombarded by multiple notifications.

## Scenario 2:
Mimi often gets overwhelmed and forgets deadlines or misses work, even after putting her schedules in a calendar app. She wants a way to remind her of upcoming deadlines and work shifts. Additionally, she would like to be able to easily track her expenses so she can budget effectively.

## Scenario 3:
Frank is having a difficult time focusing on school work, mainly because he finds himself procrastinating playing video games. He works for 5 minutes then gets distracted from the task at hand. He's having a hard time staying focused. 

# Key Principles 
## Simplicity

The product should provide a UI design that allows the users to easily understand and navigate the application’s features. By having an easy-to-use interface, we want the user to be able to use all the features available on our app and retrieve the most benefit from each feature. We will ensure optimal usage by having a decluttered-interface and a well integrated app design.

## Integrated Features

We will aim to create a one-stop-shop app for all of our users’ productivity needs. By having multiple productivity features in one app, we will be able to ensure that our clients can accomplish their tasks and schedule their lives optimally without having to switch between multiple services.
