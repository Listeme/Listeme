# Sprint 1 Planning Meeting:

The Sprint 1 planning meeting was held on January 30, 2022 on Discord. The purpose of this meeting is to clearly indicate the sprint goal, identify all of the stories that will be handled this sprint, related tasks to those stories and how these tasks will be distributed amongst the seven team members. All of the team members have attended the meeting. The Project Demo to the TA will be done on February 11, 2022. We selected the user stories that we want to handle this sprint from the product backlog as well as trying to create subtasks such that everyone was given an equal amount of work to be finished for the demo meeting of sprint 1.
