  Interesting project! I think more works need to be done on the presentational layer, as discussed. Considering a single theme is important, and would greatly help with your project.
  More documentation would be ideal! I think this project has a lot of individual moving parts, so keeping an eye on your docs is key.
  
  Can't wait to use this project when I study! Looking forward to it!
